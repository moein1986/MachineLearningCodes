In "LinearRegr.m", a simple linear regression model with one variable is implemented to predict the profits of a chain restaurant in different cities. The Gradient Descent method is used to optimize the regressin parameters. 

In "LinearRegr_Multi.m", a linear regression model with multiple variables is implemented to predict  the prices of houses in terms of their sizes and bedroom numbers. The Gradient Descent method is used to optimize the regressin parameters.
