In "LinearRegr.m", a simple linear regression model with one variable is implemented. The Gradient Descent method is used to optimize the regressin parameters. 

In "LinearRegr_Multi.m", a linear regression model with multiple variables is implemented. The Gradient Descent method is used to optimize the regressin parameters.
