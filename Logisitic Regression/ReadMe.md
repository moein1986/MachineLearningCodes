In "LogisiticRegr.m" a logistic regression model is implemented for a given train set. The unconstrained nonlinear optimization method is used to optimize the regression parameters. 

In "Regularized_LogisiticRegr.m" a regularized logistic regression model is implemented for a given dataset. Polynimal features are added to model to capture the non-linearity. The unconstrained nonlinear optimization method is used to optimize the regression parameters.
